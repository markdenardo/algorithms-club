## MY DEFINITION
A last in first out data structure that allow for elements to be added to the top, removed from the top and peeked at without removing.

## Book Definition
The stack data structure is identical, in concept, to a physical stack of objects. When you add an item to a stack, you place it on top of the stack. When you remove an item from a stack, you always remove the top-most item.

## Operations
There are only two essential operations for a stack:
- push: Adding an element to the top of the stack
- pop: Removing the top element of the stack
- peek: See what is on top

# Performance
All operations are `O(1)`
